				Tamale Chili is a homestyle ground beef chili with chunks of tamales to up the ante for pure delicious flavor.

            <p>
                Tamale Chili is my recipe of the day for the blogging event Chili Cook-Off. I've made a lot of chili in my time. But for something a little different I decided to throw some tamales in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sort of like a joke, you know. This time of year it is Chili Today and Hot Tamale. IOW, if you're not hungry for chili yet, just wait five minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                And this is really some comfort food from my past. I have always enjoyed tamales buried in chili. Then covered with  shredded cheese and sliced jalapenos.
            </p>
            <p>
                It might be food for slumming in the kitchen. But it’s quick and I always loved it.
